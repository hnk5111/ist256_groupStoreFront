For the group project, you’ll be working on an exciting task that involves developing a storefront website. This project is designed to help you apply the skills and concepts you’ve learned in class, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and database management.

In this project, you will build a fully functional storefront website. Each week, you’ll complete tasks that progressively add features to your site. You’ll begin by creating forms to manage shopper and product information, then move on to adding shipping options and integrating the website with a database for data storage.

By the end of the project, your website will be capable of managing shopper details, product inventory, and order processing, with all data seamlessly stored and retrieved from a database.
